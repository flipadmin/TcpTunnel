<Settings xmlns="https://github.com/kpreisser/TcpTunnel">
  <!-- A 'Gateway' instance listens on the specified TCP port (optionally using SSL/TLS), and waits for
       connections from both the 'Proxy-Server' and the 'Proxy-Client' instances. -->
  <Instance type="gateway">
    <!-- You can define multiple listeners (IP + port + optional SSL/TLS certificate). -->
    
    <!-- Specify one of 'certificateHash', 'certificatePfxFilePath', or 'certificatePemFilePath' attributes
         in order to use SSL/TLS. 
    
         On Windows, you can specify the 'certificateHash' attribute containing the hash of an SSL/TLS 
         certificate used from the Windows Certificate Store.
         The cert needs to be stored in the current user's or the local machine's "My" certificate store, and
         you need to be able to access the private key (i.e. you probably need to run the app as administrator
         when the cert is stored in the local machine store).
         With Powershell, you can go to the path "Cert:\LocalMachine\My" for the local machine, or
         "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" for the current user.
        
         Alternatively, or if running on other OSes like Linux, you can specify the 'certificatePfxFilePath' 
         attribute containing a file path of a .pfx (PKCS #12) file that contains the SSL/TLS certificate
         (and optionally the pfx password with the 'certificatePfxPassword' attribute); or you can specify
         the 'certificatePemFilePath' and 'certificatePemKeyFilePath' attributes to load a certificate from
         PEM files.
         (Note: Using PEM files currently doesn't always seem to work on Windows; in that case use a .pfx
         file.)

    <!-- If none of the certificate* attributes are specified, SSL/TLS is not used. In that case, you
         need to specify useSsl="0" in the proxy-client and proxy-server configurations, but this
         also means the connection to the gateway will not be secure (authenticated and encrypted),
         and should only be used for testing/development purposes.
